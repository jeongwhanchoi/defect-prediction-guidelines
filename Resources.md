# Cross-Project Defect Prediction (CPDP)

## Resources
* [A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis on Cross Project Defect Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8097045) (2017) - The paper summarizes and synthesizes the existing Cross-Project Defect Prediction (CPDP) studies to identify what kind of independent variables, modeling techniques,
performance evaluation criteria, and approaches are used in building CPDP models, as well as to explore the predictive performance of cross project defect
prediction models compared with that of within project models.
